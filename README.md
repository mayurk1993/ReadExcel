# ReadExcel

The code uses Apache POI which provides pure Java libraries for reading and writing files in Microsoft Office format such as word, 
powerpoint and excel. This code file ReadExcel.java has been written to achieve following task:

Reading the content of excel file and write/append it to text document.

Path to excel file and text document has been hardcoded for now in the code.

You need to resolve dependency by adding following jars to the project:

dom4j-1.6.jar
poi-3.9.jar
poi-ooxml-3.9.jar
poi-ooxml-schemas-3.9.jar
xmlbeans-xmlpublic-2.3.0.jar
xbean-2.3.0.jar
